# Longy
A blockchain based game for SF Blockchain week. The game is run on it's own blockchain using the Cosmos-Sdk.

TODO: explain the game and why there is a "master node"

# Install and Test
To build the project:
```
make install
```

Before you can run the tests you'll need to set up the runtime environment so
the system can connect with Eventbrite. To do that, export the environment
variable `EVENTBRITE_AUTH` containing your Eventbrite access token. In addition,
the system needs to know which Eventbrite event to work with. Set that in
`EVENTBRITE_EVENT`.

```
export EVENTBRITE_EVENT="3414213431"
export EVENTBRITE_AUTH="ewifkjaweklfheaklj"
```

To lint and test:
```
make test
```

## Running database tests
The database tests depend on a local DynamoDB instance running on port 8000.
To enable the tests, first launch the DynamoDB service:
```
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
```

Then run the suite in an environment with:
```
ENABLE_DB_TESTS=true
```
eg:
```
ENABLE_DB_TESTS=true make test
```
